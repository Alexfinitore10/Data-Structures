# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms, primarily for educational purposes. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science.

## Data Structures Implemented
* **Binary Search Tree:** A binary tree where the nodes are arranged in a specific order. This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.
* **Binary Tree:** A generic tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
* **List And Vectors:** Implementations of dynamic and static arrays and linked and static lists, providing efficient ways to store and manipulate collections of data in both ways.
* **MatrixVec and MatrixCSR:** Implementations for matrix-vector operations, including the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format for efficient storage of sparse matrices.
* **Stack And Queue:** Classic data structures used for various applications, such as function calls, expression evaluation, and breadth-first search.

## Programming Language
The primary programming language used in this project is **C++**. C++ provides a balance of performance and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for implementing data structures and algorithms.
